Test the simple logic with a concrete example.

Day 0:
- Have $100k
- Short $50k of TQQQ at $20/share = -2,500 shares
- Short $50k of SQQQ at $200/share = -250 shares
- Now have $200k cash (original $100k + $100k from short proceeds)
- Buy BIL with $200k at $91/share = 2,198 shares

Day 1 (no rebalance):
- TQQQ at $21 (up $1)
- SQQQ at $198 (down $2)
- BIL at $91.01 (up $0.01)

- TQQQ P&L: -2,500 * ($20 - $21) = -2,500 * (-$1) = +$2,500 (loss, price went up)
  Wait, that's wrong. If I'm short and price goes up, I lose money.
  P&L = shares * (entry - current) = -2,500 * ($20 - $21) = -2,500 * (-$1) = $2,500

  Actually let's think about it differently:
  - I shorted at $20, now it's $21
  - To close the short, I'd need to buy back at $21
  - I sold for $50k, buy back costs $52.5k
  - Loss = -$2,500

  Formula: For shorts, P&L = -shares_short * (current_price - entry_price)
  Or: P&L = shares_short * (entry_price - current_price) where shares_short is negative

  So: P&L_TQQQ = -2,500 * ($21 - $20) = -$2,500

- SQQQ P&L: -250 * ($198 - $200) = -250 * (-$2) = +$500 (gain, price went down)
  Check: sold at $200 for $50k, buy back at $198 costs $49.5k, profit = $500 âœ“

- BIL value: 2,198 * $91.01 = $200,021.98

Equity = BIL value + short P&L
       = $200,021.98 + (-$2,500) + $500
       = $198,021.98

Starting equity was $100k, so return = ($198,021.98 - $100k) / $100k = +98.02%

Wait that can't be right. Let me recalculate...

Actually, the equity calculation is wrong. Let me think about it as a balance sheet:

Assets:
- BIL: $200,021.98

Liabilities:
- Short TQQQ: owe 2,500 shares worth 2,500 * $21 = $52,500
- Short SQQQ: owe 250 shares worth 250 * $198 = $49,500
- Total liabilities: $102,000

Equity = Assets - Liabilities = $200,021.98 - $102,000 = $98,021.98

So starting with $100k, we now have $98,021.98 = -1.98% return.

That makes sense! Short TQQQ lost us money, short SQQQ made us money, BIL made a tiny bit.
